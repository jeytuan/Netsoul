# Netsoul w/ Etherlink & Gateway.fm
: A Web3 Gaming Exploration

## Overview

Netsoul, the cross-chain gaming platform, has teamed up with Etherlink and Gateway.fm for an enhanced Web3 experience. By incorporating Gateway.fm's Presto Rollup, Netsoul aims to optimize the deployment of smart contracts across blockchains seamlessly.

## Project Summary

Netsoul stands at the intersection of gaming and blockchain technology, offering a gamified environment to learn, interact, and explore various blockchain ecosystems. The integration with Gateway.fm's Presto Rollup and Oracle allows Netsoul to harness real-time data for advanced gaming scenarios and currency conversions.

In this project, we explore the advanced features of Etherlink by incorporating Account Abstraction and mechanisms to mitigate and utilize Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) to promote a fairer, more equitable blockchain environment. Our platform is designed to reduce barriers to entry and enhance transparency, fostering a healthy competitive landscape in the blockchain ecosystem.

### Key Features
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Our platform includes a sandbox terminal feature that allows users to directly interact with the Etherlink RPC and testnet links. This foundational functionality enables real-time testing and interaction within a controlled environment, demonstrating our commitment to providing a robust and user-centric blockchain experience. Our platform now includes Gateway.fm alongside Etherlink, expanding our reach and capabilities within the blockchain space.

- **Smart Contract Workshop**: Future plans include a dedicated workshop for users to create and deploy smart contracts, supported by Presto's Rollup feature for efficiency and scalability.

- **Oracle Data Utilization**: We are refining our Oracle Integration Test to interact with CoinGecko and Chainlink, aiming to fetch crucial data like price changes and gas prices effectively.

- **MEV Strategic Use**: We have started the frontend integration to interact with Etherlink’s MEV solutions. While full integration to distribute rewards back to the community is underway, this feature will continue to be developed to ensure a more balanced and less exploitative blockchain environment.

## Narrative for the Novel Use Case on Etherlink
As Netsoul concepts, MEV Plant contributes to a more transparent and equitable gaming economy within the blockchain space. In the near future quests could lead to real impact, like burning a portion of MEV to offset gas fees across the network or fund public goods within the game ecosystem.

We will also consider how Netsoul can reflect real-world blockchain dynamics and educate players about MEV and its role in blockchain networks, incentivizing players to take part in healthy network behaviors.

At Netsoul we lean into the gaming aspect to distinguish our application as a fresh frontier for pushing blockchain cutting edge features to its potential.

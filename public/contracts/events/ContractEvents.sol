Explanation
RoleAssigned: Emitted when a role is assigned to an account.
RoleRevoked: Emitted when a role is revoked from an account.
OperationalSettingChanged: Emitted when an operational setting is changed.
TokensMinted: Emitted when tokens are minted to a specific address.
AuditConducted: Emitted when an audit is conducted by an Angel.
DivineInterventionExecuted: Emitted when a divine intervention is executed by an Archangel.
Usage
Role Management: The RoleAssigned and RoleRevoked events are useful for tracking role changes.
Operational Changes: The OperationalSettingChanged event helps in tracking any changes to operational settings.
Token Minting: The TokensMinted event tracks token minting operations.
Audits and Interventions: The AuditConducted and DivineInterventionExecuted events provide transparency for audits and interventions performed by special roles.
Next Steps
Integrate with Contracts: Ensure your main contracts import and use these events where appropriate.
Testing: Write tests to verify that these events are emitted correctly during contract operations.
Documentation: Document these events in your smart contract documentation to provide transparency to users and developers.
By using this ContractEvents.sol file, you can standardize and centralize the definition of events across your smart contract system, ensuring consistency and clarity.

/**
Explanation
Roles: Defines the CEO and CFO roles, allowing them to perform specific security operations.
Multi-Signature Transactions: Implements a basic multi-signature transaction mechanism where transactions need to be approved by both the CEO and CFO before execution.
createTransaction: Allows the CEO to create a transaction.
approveTransaction: Allows the CFO to approve a created transaction.
executeTransaction: Allows the CEO to execute an approved transaction, ensuring it's not reentrant.
Ether Management: Allows the contract to receive and withdraw Ether.
Events: Emits events for creating, approving, and executing transactions to provide transparency and traceability.
Usage
Create Transactions: The CEO can create transactions using createTransaction.
Approve Transactions: The CFO can approve transactions using approveTransaction.
Execute Transactions: The CEO can execute approved transactions using executeTransaction.
Ether Management: The contract can receive Ether and the CFO can withdraw Ether.
Next Steps
Integrate with Other Contracts: Ensure this contract integrates well with other parts of your system, like AccessControlManagement.sol, FinancialOperations.sol, and OperationalSettings.sol.
Testing: Write comprehensive tests to verify that the security features work as expected.
Deployment: Deploy the contract to your preferred Ethereum testnet and then to mainnet once fully tested.
By following these steps, you can ensure that your smart contract system is robust, secure, and ready for deployment. */

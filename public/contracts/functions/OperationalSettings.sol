/**
Explanation
Roles: Defines the CEO role, allowing the CEO to change operational settings.
changeOperationalSetting: Allows the CEO to change an operational setting, and emits an event when the setting is changed.
getOperationalSetting: Allows anyone to view an operational setting.
onlyCEO Modifier: A modifier to ensure that only accounts with the CEO role can call certain functions.
Events: Inherits events from ContractEvents to provide transparency for operational setting changes.
Usage
Change Settings: The changeOperationalSetting function is used to update operational settings.
View Settings: The getOperationalSetting function is used to retrieve the current value of an operational setting.
Event Emission: The contract emits events when operational settings are changed, providing a log of changes.
Next Steps
Integrate with Other Contracts: Ensure this contract integrates well with other parts of your system, like AccessControlManagement.sol and FinancialOperations.sol.
Testing: Write comprehensive tests to verify that the operational settings functions work as expected.
Deployment: Deploy the contract to your preferred Ethereum testnet and then to mainnet once fully tested.
By following these steps, you can ensure that your smart contract system is robust, secure, and ready for deployment. */

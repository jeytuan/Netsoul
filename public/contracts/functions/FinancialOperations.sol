/**
Explanation
Roles: Defines the CFO and ARCHANGEL roles, allowing them to perform specific financial operations.
mintTokens: Allows the CFO to mint new tokens to a specified address, ensuring the address is not zero.
transferFunds: Allows the CFO to transfer funds to another address, ensuring the address is not zero and that the sender has enough balance.
balanceOf: A public view function that returns the balance of a specified account.
totalSupply: A public view function that returns the total supply of the token.
Events: Inherits events from ContractEvents to provide transparency for minting and transferring operations.
Next Steps
Integrate with Other Contracts: Ensure this contract integrates well with other parts of your system, like AccessControlManagement.sol.
Testing: Write comprehensive tests to verify that the financial operations work as expected.
Deployment: Deploy the contract to your preferred Ethereum testnet and then to mainnet once fully tested.
By following these steps, you can ensure that your smart contract system is robust, secure, and ready for deployment.

/**
 * 
TestingService.ts will abstract the logic required to interact with various testing frameworks and collate their results. 
This service will allow you to start tests, check their progress, and retrieve results from a centralized service rather than directly within components, 
which helps in keeping your components clean and focused on the UI rather than the logic.

Here's what you can do with each part of this service:

TestSuite Type: Defines the structure of a test suite with a name and an execute function that when called, runs the test suite and returns the results.
TestResult Type: Defines the structure of the test result with a status and an optional message.
registerTestSuite(): Allows different parts of your application to register test suites with the service. 
This could be called from within components like BlockchainTester, UITester, etc.
runAllTestSuites(): Goes through all registered test suites, executes them, and collates the results into a single array.
This is a basic starting point. Depending on the complexity of your testing needs, you may need to expand this service significantly. You could introduce:

Real-time result updates via callbacks or events.
Timeout handling for test suites that take too long to execute.
Detailed error logging for failed tests.
Prioritization or ordering of test execution.
Concurrency control to run multiple tests in parallel if possible.
With this setup, you can use the TestingService to manage and run tests from a central location in your application, providing a scalable and maintainable testing infrastructure.

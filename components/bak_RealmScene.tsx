/**
 * Code Implementation for a "Realm Page"
You could create a new realm where MEV concepts are a core part of the gameplay. This could be a new scene in Phaser, similar to your DemoScene, but focused on MEV interactions. For instance, you could have a 'Marketplace' scene for MEV Auctions or a 'Validator's Council' for decision-making around MEV distribution.

Here's a rudimentary outline of what that new scene could look like:  */

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import Phaser from 'phaser';

const RealmScene: React.FC = () => {
  const [warpMenuVisible, setWarpMenuVisible] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const config: Phaser.Types.Core.GameConfig = {
      type: Phaser.AUTO,
      width: 1069,
      height: 768,
      parent: 'mev-realm-container',
      scene: {
        preload: preload,
        create: create,
      },
    };

    new Phaser.Game(config);

    function preload(this: Phaser.Scene) {
      this.load.image('island', 'images/game/platforms/island_concept.png');
      // Load an image for the glowing effect
      this.load.image('glow', 'path_to_glow_image.png');
    }

    function create(this: Phaser.Scene) {
      this.add.image(this.cameras.main.width / 2, this.cameras.main.height / 2, 'island');
      // Add a glow effect to the central point, adjusting the position as needed
      const glow = this.add.image(this.cameras.main.width / 2, this.cameras.main.height / 2, 'glow');
      glow.setScale(0.5); // Adjust scale as needed
      // Add a simple tween to make the glow pulse
      this.tweens.add({
        targets: glow,
        scale: { from: 0.5, to: 0.6 }, // Tweaking these values will change the pulsing effect
        ease: 'Linear',
        duration: 800,
        repeat: -1,
        yoyo: true
      });

      // Now make the glow interactive
      glow.setInteractive();
      glow.on('pointerdown', () => {
        // Toggle the visibility of the warp menu
        setWarpMenuVisible(v => !v);
      });
    }

    return () => {
      // Cleanup the game instance when the component unmounts
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <div id="mev-realm-container" />
      {warpMenuVisible && (
        <div className="warp-menu">
          <ul>
            <li>Warp Point</li>
            <li>Haven</li>
            <li>Solana</li>
            <li>Etherlink</li>
            <li>Skale</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      )}
    </>
  );
};

export default RealmScene;



  

/**
 * MEV-Related Game Mechanics Integration
To integrate MEV into your game, you could conceptualize it as a "worldly mechanic" where players can interact with it in several ways:

MEV as a Resource: Treat MEV as a collectible resource in the game world, where players can discover or earn it through gameplay. It can be used to upgrade abilities, purchase unique items, or access special areas of the game.
Validator Nodes: Players could set up their own "Validator Nodes" as part of the gameplay, contributing to the network's security. Successful validation might include battling blockchain 'monsters' (representing invalid transactions) and earning MEV as a reward.
MEV Redistribution: Players could have the option to redistribute their collected MEV back into the game's ecosystem, either to enhance the community (like buffing allies or upgrading communal areas) or as part of a staking mechanic to earn passive rewards.
MEV Auctions: Create an in-game auction system where players can bid for MEV, simulating the real-world practice of miners/validators getting paid for transaction ordering.
Transparency Quests: To emphasize transparency and fair competition, introduce quests that involve uncovering hidden MEV-related information or strategies used by 'corrupt validators' or 'bosses'. Successful missions could reduce overall MEV impacts and promote a healthier game economy.
For the UI presentation:

Have a dedicated MEV 'meter' or 'inventory slot' on the player's HUD.
Include a "Validator's Sanctum" or similar realm where players can interact with MEV mechanics, visible on the world map.
Visual indicators for when MEV is being used, earned, or redistributed, such as distinctive particle effects or iconography.

/**
 * Enhancing the MEV Plant ("BuildingPlant.tsx")
To integrate the BuildingPlant.tsx with the terminal (TestScene.tsx), you could make the MEV Plant interactive by allowing users to:

1. Start MEV-related tasks from the terminal.
2. Fetch live stats about MEV opportunities or validator performances.
3. Bid in MEV auctions using commands in the terminal.
4. Trigger quests and receive updates on their progress via the terminal logs.

This would give a sense of interaction between the UI elements and the backend services you might have. 
You could simulate these interactions for the hackathon or hook them up to actual smart contracts if you have the infrastructure ready.

/**
 * 
Explanation:

- VM Setup: Initializes an Ethereum VM instance. It uses the ethereumjs-vm package, which is configured to simulate the specific conditions (e.g., london hardfork).
- Simulate Transaction: The function simulateTransaction runs when the user wants to simulate the contract's behavior. 
It takes compiled bytecode as input, which should be passed to the component as a prop.
Transaction Handling: The transaction is simulated based on the bytecode. The Ethereum VM runs this bytecode and provides results, 
such as gas usage or any exceptions that might occur.
Error Handling: Captures and logs any errors that occur during the simulation, providing feedback to the user.
3. Improvements and Security Concerns
User Input and Validation: Ensure that the bytecode input is properly validated and sanitized to avoid injection attacks or execution of malicious code.
Enhanced Feedback: Provide more detailed feedback about gas costs, potential optimizations, or common pitfalls detected during the simulation.
Integration with UI: Make sure the simulator's UI is intuitive, providing clear instructions and results to the users.
Conclusion
This Simulator.js setup provides a basic framework to simulate Ethereum transactions using bytecode. 
As the project progresses, you may want to extend its functionality or integrate it more deeply with other components of the Smart Contract Workshop, 
like linking it directly to contract deployment outcomes or test scenarios based on real-world conditions. This will make the tool more robust and useful for 
developers working within your platform.
